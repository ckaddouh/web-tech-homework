1. What is the purpose of `git commit` ?
 - This takes your staged changes and "marks" them in your local history. It is a snapshot of your project at a particular
   point in time. 
2. What happens when you push to GitHub?
 - When you push to GitHub, your local commits get sent to the remote repository. 
3. Why should we commit multiple times instead of once at the end?
 - The more often you commit, the more "snapshots" of your work that you have which you can revert back to in case anything
   goes wrong. It also makes it easier to follow and understand your work. 
4. What is the difference between local repository and remote repository?
 - Your local repository is stored on your computer and only seen by you, while the remote repository is connected to GitHub
   and stored on a server. Multiple people can interact with the remote repository, but only you can interact with your local
   one.
